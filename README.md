# SpringBoot-CRUD-restAPI-GlobalException


Project Description:

The project aims to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Spring Boot, RESTful web services, Hibernate, and MySQL database. Additionally, it will include a global exception handler implemented using the `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations.

Technologies Used:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Hibernate
- MySQL
- RESTful web services

Project Structure:
1. Model: This package contains the entity classes representing the data objects in the application, such as `User`, `Product`, etc. These classes will be annotated with Hibernate annotations to map them to corresponding database tables.

2. Repository: This package contains interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA's `CrudRepository` or `JpaRepository` interfaces. These interfaces define the database operations for the entity classes. In this case, we'll have repositories for `UserRepository`, `ProductRepository`, etc.

4. Controller: This package contains the RESTful controller classes that expose endpoints for the CRUD operations. The controller classes will use the service classes to perform the desired operations. For instance, `UserController` will have methods like `createUser`, `getUser`, `updateUser`, and `deleteUser`, which will be mapped to the corresponding HTTP methods and endpoints.

5. ExceptionHandler: This package contains an exception handler class annotated with `@ControllerAdvice`. This class will handle global exceptions that occur within the application. The `@ExceptionHandler` annotation will be used to define methods that handle specific exceptions and return appropriate responses. For instance, `ExceptionHandlerController` may have a method annotated with `@ExceptionHandler(value = {UserNotFoundException.class})` to handle the `UserNotFoundException` and return a custom error response.

6. Configuration: This package contains any additional configuration classes required for the application, such as database configuration, security configuration, etc.

7. Application: This class serves as the entry point for the application. It includes the `main` method to start the Spring Boot application.

8. Database: The project will utilize a MySQL database to store the data. The database connection details will be specified in the application configuration files (`application.properties` or `application.yml`).

With this project structure, you can implement the desired CRUD operations using RESTful endpoints and handle exceptions using the `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` annotations. Remember to configure the Hibernate settings and database connection details accordingly in the application configuration files.

This project will provide a robust and scalable solution for managing data through RESTful APIs while ensuring proper exception handling for a seamless user experience.
